    <h1>Reflection on Recreating Page 40 Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</h1>

    <p>
      This project involved recreating page 40 of Punk Planet issue 62 in 5
      files: HTML for structure (recreated page, index, and reflection), CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity.
    </p>

    <h2>What Was Easy</h2>
    <p>
      Rewriting the HTML structure was easier. Once the semantic tags and class names 
      were in place, linking the CSS and JavaScript files was quite simple. Setting global 
      styles on the body element also saved a lot of repetition throughout the stylesheet.
    </p>

    <h2>What Was Challenging</h2>
    <p>
      Getting the three-column CSS Grid layout to feel like a real magazine page took 
      fine-tuning of gap sizes, padding, and text alignment. It was also challenging to include 
      all the necessary css parts into the sylesheet, as well as come up with some ideas for the JS part.
    </p>

    <h2>What Was Not Possible</h2>
    <p>
      Not including the illustration in the middle of the page. Making sure that all
      paragraphs begin and end the same as the original newspaper page 40.
