              After a recent show in Denver, a young bearded fan approached David
              Pajo—Papa M for those of you who have not been keeping track—and
              offered him some money. <q>This is for all the music that I've
              downloaded from you.</q> <q>Keep it,</q> Pajo replied. Not satisfied,
              the bearded fan opened a bag full of pills—<q>Well, can I give you
              some pills or something?</q> <q>No, man,</q> Pajo laughed, turning him
              down. <q>Really, I do the same thing.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
              As Pajo tells the story at a café on Manhattan's Lower East Side, I
              laugh. After all, it's a funny story. But it's also a subtle reminder
              that the people that make the records are fans too. Pajo is no
              exception. Our breakfast meeting was supposed to be an interview, but
              we talked as much about other people's music as we did about his. At
              the end of the interview, Pajo apologized sheepishly, <q>Sorry for
              rambling, I'm afraid it's going to be all about the Mekons and
              Dylan.</q> Just a few years ago the apology would have surprised me.
              After all, it's a mighty long toss from Dylan's <i>Self Portrait</i>
              to Slint's

              quirky folk songs are a perfect soundtrack for the Louisville of my

            <h3>Why move to New York City?</h3>
            <p>
              Just to play music and be around friends. I mostly wanted to get out
              of Louisville. Of all my friends that I grew up with, there are only a
              few left there that are still playing music. I'd been there for so
              long. I just wanted to go somewhere. Every time I come here, the
              culture is just slammed into your face. There's always so much going
              on. I needed some of that; I need a year of that.
            </p>

            <h3>Are you working on Papa M music?</h3>
            <p>
              Right now I'm working on stuff that I think is going to be solo stuff,
              but I don't know if I'm going to call it Papa M or not. The new stuff
              sounds so good that I was thinking of doing it under another name.

              I think I'm getting back into that again. I got really into
              traditional music for a while there, which I'm still into. But trying
              to write traditional type songs, like verse-chorus type songs, doesn't
              really come naturally to me.
            </p>
            <h3>Really?</h3>
            <p>Yeah, it's really hard.</p>

            <h3>Are you singing on the stuff you're working on now?</h3>
            <p>
              Yeah, there's a little bit of that. That's actually the hardest part.
              The lyrics and all that just drive me insane—it just doesn't come
              naturally to me.
            </p>

            <h3>That surprises me. You sing with an almost effortless voice. You make it seem easy!</h3>
            <p>It's just hard to get me to do it. I don't trust my own voice.</p>

            <h3>Were you scared the first time you sang on a recording?</h3>
            <p>Yeah.</p>

              <i>Spiderland.</i> Pajo played guitar in the Louisville band
              that—according to whom you ask—changed everything or just changed a
              lot. A few years later he joined up with Tortoise in Chicago and made
              two records. He has been called to play with Stereolab, Royal Trux,
              and longtime Louisville compadre Will Oldham.
            </p>
            <p>
              All along—for a decade now—Pajo has been making his own music under
              variations of the moniker <q>M.</q> There was <q>M is the Thirteenth
              Letter,</q> <q>Aerial M,</q> and more recently <q>Papa M.</q> The
              vast majority of the <q>M</q> releases were of the liquid, ethereal
              variety familiar to Slint or Tortoise fans. Then he started singing,
              and everything changed.
            </p>
            <p>
              With his recent Papa M recordings, Pajo has invented a kind of
              otherworldly folk music. He takes freely from a rich tradition, but
              leaves something entirely his own. And at a time when you'd think
              being based in Louisville made the most sense—his

                seemed like it was a way of carving out, or discovering, your
                identity. What does it say about that process when you are ready to
                be something <i>other</i> than Papa M?

              When it started out, I wanted to do my own thing and I wanted to do
              it all myself—I wanted to play all the instruments; I wanted to record
              it. I didn't know anything about recording or microphones, I was just
              going to teach myself. Then I got excited about singing and trying to
              write songs with words. And then I got more into electronica type
              stuff. It seems like it's always changing. It's almost like I get
              bored really easily or something.
            </p>
            <h3>And are you changing again?</h3>
            <p>
              I don't know how it's going to end up, but right now the songs are
              getting more dissonant again. When I was younger I was into
              anti-melodies; melodies that were unusual.

            <h3>Did you run it by friends?</h3>
            <p>
              Yeah, I recorded myself on a Walkman. I think I played it for Will
              [Oldham] and he really liked it and thought it should be on the single
              I was doing, so I put it on there. I never even thought about singing
              and then I thought, <q>Well, this is a territory that I've never
              really messed with, maybe I should try it.</q> I have tons of tapes
              of me singing that I'd never release.
            </p>
            <h3>Now you sing on most of your songs. When did the confidence creep in?</h3>
            <p>
              It was actually <i>Papa M Sings</i>, which was recorded right after a
              long tour where I was playing all instrumental stuff. Most of the
              bands that were opening for us were instrumental, too. So I came home
              and sang on all these cover songs and I liked it. I'm still trying to
              figure it out.
